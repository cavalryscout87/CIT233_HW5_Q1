//Design a class named patientType inherited from the class personType with additional data members to store a patient’s ID, age, date of birth, attending physician’s name, the date when the patient was admitted to the hospital, and the date when the patient was dismissed from the hospital. IMPORTANT NOTE: use the class dateType to store the date of birth, admit date, discharge date (dMonth, dDay, dYear, dCentury). Use the class doctorType to store the attending physician’s name. Add appropriate constructors and member functions to initialize, access, and manipulate data members.
